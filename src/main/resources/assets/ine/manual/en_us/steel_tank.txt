Steel Fluid Tank
Full to the max!
<&steeltank>The Steel Fluid Tank is a multiblock that provides space for even larger amounts of fluids. It will store up to <config;i;steeltank_tanksize> mB of any fluid, which can be piped in through the top or bottom block. Fluids can only be extracted from the bottom center block.
Applying a redstone signal to the bottom center block will make the tank output automatically, a comparator placed there will emit a redstone signal proportional to how full the tank is. Attaching the comparator to one of the top 4 layers results in a signal proportional to the height of the comparator. For example, a comparator attached to the second layer of a tank would not emit any signal until the tank is 1/4 full and have a signal strength of 15 if the tank is half full or more.
